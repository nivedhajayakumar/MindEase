🧠 Mental Health and Well-being Surveillance for Children

📚 Project Overview
This project introduces an AI-powered assessment platform that monitors and tracks the mental well-being of children using:

✅ Structured Questionnaires – Capturing emotional states through direct responses.

✅ Facial Expression Analysis – Using AI to detect subtle emotional cues in real time.

✅ Secure, Privacy-Focused Implementation – Ensuring that sensitive data remains protected and confidential.

The system generates a comprehensive score that combines survey responses and facial expressions, providing a holistic assessment to identify potential mental health concerns.

🎯 Problem Statement:
Children’s mental health is often difficult to assess due to:


Inability to accurately express emotions.

Unnoticed subtle emotional cues.

Lack of real-time monitoring solutions.

Our solution bridges this gap by offering a hybrid assessment system that empowers educators and caregivers with actionable insights.

Options include emojis and simplified language for child-friendliness.


✅ 3. Combined AI Scoring Model


Questionnaire and facial analysis scores are combined to generate an accurate emotional profile.


✅ 4. Privacy and Security


All data is processed locally with no external storage, ensuring secure assessments.

✅ 5. User-Friendly Interface
